        <p>I am a first year student. Having spent almost a year in this college
          i have realised that it is necessary to give attention to all the subjects, with
          a special focus on Anatomy. I find anatomy difficult to memorise. But i
          know that i will surely overcome this challenge. From next year, i will
          start travel vlogging! </p>
